# PARKING-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The objective of this project is to build a Vehicle Parking management system that enables the time management and control of vehicles using number plate recognition. The system that will track the entry and exit of vehicles, maintain a listing of vehicles within the parking lot, and determine if the parking lot is full or not. It will determine the cost of per vehicle according to their time consumption.

Enrolments into the university have been increasing steadily. As the number increases, various problems arise. One such problem is to find a parking spot at the university. To make things easier for the students, faculty and the staff, it is important to have a parking management system using mobile application. This system can help reduce the time to find an empty parking spot. Historically, cities, businesses, and property developers have tried to match parking supply to growing demand for parking spaces. It has become clear, though, that simply creating more parking spaces is not sufficient to address the problem of congestion. New approaches using smart parking systems look to provide a more balanced view of parking that better manages the relationship between supply and demand. Smart parking can be defined as the use of advanced technologies for the efficient operation, monitoring, and management of parking within an urban mobility strategy.
